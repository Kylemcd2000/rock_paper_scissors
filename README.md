# rock_paper_scissors
The purpose of this project is to use the javascript skills learned create a console only playable game of rock paper scissors.
Main skills to be learned and reinforced are:
Problem solving skills - i.e. following the steps of methodically breaking down the problem into other subproblems that can solved using psuedocode before attempting to code and problems first
Javascript - becoming familiar with basic tools of javascript and how to apply those tools to solving a problem.
testing and debuggin - Its likely that things will not work as intened due to multiple reasong such logic and syntax errors. Solving these issues will give real world practice of testing, understanding errors and most importantly how to fix them.
Research - Beign the first javascript project I'm building from scratch I will most likely have questions that will need answered and properly searching for the answer using google will help in similar situations in the future.
GITHUB - following the same structure as before of commiting properly with efficient comments and maintaining a clean git repository will be good practice and help in building an attractive portfolio for future employers.
